# phase_retrieval

Introduction:
Phase retrieval is the recovery of a signal from only the magnitudes, and not the phases, of complex-valued linear measurements. Phase retrieval problems arise in many different applications, particularly in crystallography and microscopy.

Target:
1. implement traditional algorithms
2. apply the idea of Compressed Sensing to Phase Retrieval

Benchmark:
1. Wirtinger Flow Algorithm
2. Gerchberg-Saxton Algorith
3. Fineup Algorithm
4. Coordinate Descent Algorithm
5. Phaselift Algorithm
