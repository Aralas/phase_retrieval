def init_spectral(A, b0, At=None, is_scaled=False, is_truncated=False, verbose=False):
    """ Intializer proposed in Algorithm 1 of the Wirtinger Flow paper.

    This initializer forms a matrix from the data and computes the largest
    eigenvector that is shown to be positively correlated with the unknown true
    signal. This script presents both the vanilla spectral method and the
    truncated spectral method. A recently proposed 'optimal' spectral
    initializer method was proposed and is presented in a different function.

    Parameters:
    -------
    A:  ndarray or ConvolutionMatrix.
        This is the (n x m) matrix or the ConvolutionMatrix used to perform all the
        operations for the reconstruction. Prefer ConvolutionMatrix for optimization.
    At: ndarray
        Deprecated. If a ConvolutionMatrix is used, it contains this information.
    b0: array
        m x 1 real, non-negative vector consists of all the measurements.
    n:  int
        The size of the unknown signal. Deprecated, if a ConvolutionMatrix is used, it
        contains this information.
    is_truncated: bool
        If true, use the 'truncated' initializer that uses a sub-sample of the
        measurement.
    is_scale: bool
        If true, use a least-squares method to determine  the optimal scale of
        the initializer.

    Note:
    -----
    Always use an instance of the ConvolutionMatrix class prefereably.

    Returns:
    --------
    x0: array
        A n x 1 vector. It is the guess generated by the spectral method for
        the unknown signal.

    See the script 'test_init_spectral.py' for an example of proper usage of this
    function.

    Notations:
    ----------
    Our notations follow the TWF paper.
    ai is the conjugate transpose of the ith row of A.
    yi is the ith element of y, which is the element-wise square of the
    measurements b0.

    Algorithm Description:
    ----------------------
    The method has two steps
    (1) If is_truncated==True, Discard those observations yi that are
        several times greater than the mean during spectral initialization.
    (2) Calculate the leading eigenvector of a matrix Y,
        where Y = 1/m sum(yi * ai * ai') for i = 1 to m.
    The method return this leading eigenvector, which is calcualted using
    the routine specified in conv_matrix (default is scipy.sparse.eigs()).

    Note: The truncation, when used, makes the method more robust to outlier
    and performs better in practice.

    For a detailed explanation, see Algorithm 1 in the TWF paper referenced
    below.

    Optimal spectral initializer.

    Initializer recently proposed based on an optimal spectral method. The
    plain vanilla spectral initializer computes the largest eigenvector of Y
    = 1/m sum(yi * ai * ai') for i = 1 to m.  The truncated version of this
    method throws away some of the rows.  The optimal spectral nitializer
    computes the largest eigenvector of Y = 1/m sum(T(yi) * ai * ai') for i
    = 1 to m, where T(yi) is a function of yi given in equation (5) of the
    paper cited below.

    Parameters:
    -----------
       A:  m x n matrix (or optionally a function handle to a method) that
           returns A*x.
       At: The adjoint (transpose) of 'A'. If 'A' is a function handle, 'At'
           must be provided.
       b0: m x 1 real,non-negative vector consists of all the measurements.
       n:  The size of the unknown signal. It must be provided if A is a
           function handle.
       is_truncated (boolean): If true, use the 'truncated' initializer that
                              uses a sub-sample of the measurement.
       is_scaled (boolean):    If true, use a least-squares method to
                              determine  the optimal scale of the
                              initializer.

       Note: When a function handle is used, the value of 'n' (the length of
       the unknown signal) and 'At' (a function handle for the adjoint of
       'A') must be supplied.  When 'A' is numeric, the values of 'At' and
       'n' are ignored and inferred from the arguments.

    Outputs:
    --------
       x0:  A n x 1 vector. It is the guess generated by the spectral method
            for  the unknown signal.

    See the script 'test_init_optimal_spectral.m' for an example of proper usage of
    this function.

     Notation
    Our notation follows the TWF paper.
    ai is the conjugate transpose of the ith row of A.
    yi is the ith element of y, which is the element-wise square of the
    measurements b0.

     Algorithm Description.
    Calculate the leading eigenvector of a matrix Y, where Y = 1/m sum(T(yi)
    * ai * ai') for i = 1 to m, where T() is a "pre-processing" function.
    The method return this leading eigenvector,
    which is calculated using Matlab's eigs() routine.

    Note: This implementation differs from the paper in several ways that
    make it more efficient and robust.
    The papers below recommend using the power method to compute the leading
    eigenvector.  Our implemention
    uses Matlab's built-in function eigs() to get the leading eigenvector
    because of greater efficiency.

    Also, the authors define the pre-processing function
                   T(z) = (z-1)/(z+sqrt(delta)-1),
    where delta is the ratio of number of measurements to number of
    dimensions.  This formula assumes that the measurements are Gaussian with
    variance 1/n, and the unknown signal has length sqrt(n).  This assumption
    is clearly violated by most real sensing matrices and signals.  However,
    note that this measurements model yields measurements y = abs(Ax)^2 that
    have expected value E(y)=1.  For this reason, we normalize the
    measurements to have mean 1 before we apply the pre-processing function.
    We then multiply the mean back into the results when we're done
    pre-processing.
